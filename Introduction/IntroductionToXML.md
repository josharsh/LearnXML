# XML
XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. It is a text-based markup language derived from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). XML tags identify the data and are used to store and organize the data, rather than specifying how to display it like HTML tags, which are used to display the data.

# History Of XML
The history of XML begings from the roots of SGML, another markup language (Standard Generalized Markup Language). SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) is a standard for how to specify a document markup language or tag set. Such a specification is itself a document type definition (DTD). SGML is not in itself a document language, but a description of how to specify one. It is metadata
One of the most popular applications of SGML came with the development of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) by Tim Berners Lee in the late 1980s (Raggett, Lam, Alexander & Kmiec, 1998). Since its development HTML has somewhat become a victim of it’s own popularity, as it was rapidly adopted and extended in many ways, beyond it’s original vision. It remains popular today, though as a presentation technology, and is considered unsuitable as a general purpose data storage format.


# WHY XML?
## Limitation of HTML:
* Data storage and exchange is not possible using HTML.
* HTML is not extensible
* HTML is used for presentation


# HTML USE CASE:
<html>
<head>
<title> My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1> Hello There</h1>
<p> I am learning XML</p>
</body>
</html>

# Application of XML:
* Cell Phones
* Web Applications
* Voice XML
* Web Searching
* Structuring
* Meta data applications
* MathML
